## Key Takeaways
- Authorize GitHub account from command line: `gh auth login`
- Create GitHub repo from command line: `gh repo create`
- native AOT?
- .NET 6.0 vs. 7.0 vs. 8.0?
- .NET Project = a unit of compilation
    - Comparable to a Java .jar
- C# (think C++++, so the increment of the increment of C)
    - Developed to bridge gap between Visual Basic and C++
    - Visual Basic (Object-Based) was too simple and C++ was too complex
    - Very similar to Java
- .NET Core - core pieces of .NET needed so it can support cross-platform
- API - Application Programming Interface
- TDD - 1/3 of time should be spent writing tests
- HTTP status codes:
    - 200s = success
    - 300s = redirects
    - 400s = client error
    - 500s = server error
- Press `.` key while browsing a GitHub repo to open VS Code editor of current repo in local web browser
- NuGet - .NET package manager
