# Friday, March 15 Notes

- Created new CI/CD demo project to demonstrate use of containers

## Key Takeaways

- OpenShift is a distribution of Kubernetes
  - 98% of companies using Kubernetes don't run it on premises
    - Run "in the cloud"
- Hash algorithm - given an input, same output always produced
- Container - instance of an image
  - Image - set of layers as you describe
    - If started, then there's a running container of that image
    - Can have many running containers of same image
- Containers rely on namespaces in the Linux kernel
- CI/CD - Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (/Deployment)
