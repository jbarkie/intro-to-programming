# Tuesday. March 12 Notes
- Semantic Versioning
- Learned about state managements and its evolution in frontend frameworks
  - Flux, Redux, NgRx
- Added NgRx state management with new simple "counter" feature
  - Added global store to keep track of application state
  - Added specific counter state to keep track of just the local component state
  - Defined a feature with reducers definitions
  - Added actions to be dispatched when state should be updated
- Installed Angular DevTools and Redux DevTools
- Learned how to store data in local/session storage on browser
- Discussed Effects in Angular and how to use them with state management
- Added new action group at application level so that we can fetch a given user's data from local storage upon app start
## Key Takeaways
- Semantic versioning - e.g., v1.2.3
  - Major - one or more (possible) breaking changes
  - Minor - backward compatible new features (new methods, classes, etc.)
  - Patch - backward compatible bug fixes
- Difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
  - `package.json` - mandatory and lists dependencies required for given project
  - `package-lock.json` - auto-generated and lists specific versions installed
- State - the data in memory of our application
- "Stateful user interface"
  - Native apps (iOS, Android)
  - Cross-platform
    - MAUI - .NET 6 UI framework with code reusability and platform-agnostic approach
      - Can be used to develop high-performance applications for Android and iOS, as well as Windows and macOS
    - Electron (VSCode, Discord) - app runtime for writing native Chromium apps and rendering the interface and node.js for local APIs
    - Web
- Backing service - attached resource / service on which an application relies for its functionality
  - Helps to scale up
- Local retention of state (OOP) doesn't work
  - Really should have no data in a component or service that's "owned" by that thing
  - Make all application state "global" - but immutable so it can't be changed
  - Job of the component
    - Accurately project the application state to the client
      - Select some data from the store
        - Decoupled from the component (think SRP)
    - Provide affordances through which the user can indicate their intention on changing the state of the data
      - Dispatch actions (events)
- Browser storage:
    - Local storage - stored on hard drive
    - Session storage 
- Redux Tie Fighter - Effects
    - Subscribing to observables (pipe)
