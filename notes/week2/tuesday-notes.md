# Tuesday. March 12 Notes
- Semantic Versioning
- Learned about state managements and its evolution in frontend frameworks
    - Flux, Redux, NgRx
- Added NgRx state management with new simple "counter" feature
    - Added global store to keep track of application state
    - Added specific counter state to keep track of just the local component state
- Learned how to use Angular DevTools and Redux DevTools
## Key Takeaways
- Semantic versioning - e.g., v1.2.3
    - Major - one or more (possible) breaking changes
    - Minor - backward compatible new features (new methods, classes, etc.)
    - Patch - backward compatible bug fixes
- Difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
    - `package.json` - mandatory and lists dependencies required for given project
    - `package-lock.json` - auto-generated and lists specific versions installed
- State - the data in memory of our application
- "Stateful user interface"
    - Native apps (iOS, Android)
    - Cross-platform
        - MAUI - .NET 6 UI framework with code reusability and platform-agnostic approach 
            - Can be used to develop high-performance applications for Android and iOS, as well as Windows and macOS
        - Electron (VSCode, Discord) - app runtime for writing native Chromium apps and rendering the interface and node.js for local APIs
        - Web
- Backing service - attached resource / service on which an application relies for its functionality 
    - Helps to scale up
- Local retention of state (OOP) doesn't work
    - Really should have no data in a component or service that's "owned" by that thing
    - Make all application state "global" - but immutable so it can't be changed
