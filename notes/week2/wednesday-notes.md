# Wednesday, March 13 Notes
- Created new ASP.NET Core Web API for our Angular frontend
    - Controller based API and routing
        - Last API did not use controllers
## Key Takeaways
- SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services
    - XML formatting
    - Designed for and first used by Microsoft in 1998
    - Largely replaced by REST architecture (thought to serve more than 70% of public APIs today)
- "Backend for Frontend" - adapter APIs
- "Connascent" - form of coupling - "born, lives, and dies together"
