# Wednesday, March 13 Notes
- Created new ASP.NET Core Web API for our Angular frontend
    - Controller based API and routing
        - Last API did not use controllers
- Learned history of ASP.NET MVC
    - "Active Server Pages"
- Added new records for defining the structure of the CreateTodos Request/Response
    - Defined endpoint in TodosController
- Learned how to use EntityFrameworkCore to communicate with a database
    - Must add user input from request into an entity, perform validation, then write to database
        - Don't return entity from database - filter out the response from corresponding entity first
    - Check that the SQL statements being executed by .NET (language integrated query) are valid and make sense
- `add-migration "name"` and `update-database` in Package Manager Console 
    - Manage database migration
        - Update database schema in a controlled and versioned manner
        - Can apply schema changes without losing data and can be version controlled alongside code that uses the database
- Added input validation to user data
    - Can use attributes, Fluent, more
    - How to return a bad request and when should you provide further details to user regarding the error
        - Check the ModelState 
- Learned Async/Await
    - Async methods always have names that end with Async
        - Always return a `Task<T>`
## Key Takeaways
- SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services
    - XML formatting
    - Designed for and first used by Microsoft in 1998
    - Largely replaced by REST architecture (thought to serve more than 70% of public APIs today)
- "Backend for Frontend" - adapter APIs
- "Connascent" - form of coupling - "born, lives, and dies together"
- Anytime you do anything I/O bound - must use Async/Await
    - Communicating over network, to database, etc.
- Get a grasp on why we're solving problems with a particular solution
    - Then you can find a selling point for whatever proposal you have
    - Propose a set number of solutions
    - Talk to as many people individually as you can and see what they think
        - People feel less comfortable sharing opinions in group settings
    - Get a senior dev to walk through the code with you
        - At your pace, so you can stop and ask questions when you need it
        - Start by looking at tests - they reveal the intention
            - Set some breakpoints and step through it
- "A Curious Conversation"
    - Start conversations with other people in different areas/roles
        - What do they like? What do they dislike?
            - Note the patterns
- Lee's Coding Power Hours & other events
    - Angular office hours? Accessibility office hours?
